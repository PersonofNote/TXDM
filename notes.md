For me:

-Implement research vs client filter before even entering the form flow
-Options would be condensed flow vs longer flow
-Quick readme hub at the first step "wide range of people with this type of expertise; we welcome you to walk through the different versions of the app we are offering, but has been prioritized based on
the clia format vs not"
-I am almost thinking these should be separate forms entirely
-Should this be a clia filter or a totallly different page
-Checkbox for "show me only Clia data" -> hook that up
-This is for: diagnosis or research

-Remove ability to close sidebar


-Add an "other" option with a text input. 

- This will require: refactoring the backend a bit. 

Tissue -> Bioliquid -> vs Cells, or live vs dead, THEN populate the buttons

Autologous samples (?)

Cells/live cells/

Airtable will need: column to populate the units


"If we're returning results where we can input an arbitrary "other" parameter, that's great for the us to know, but we can't really automatically filter on "other," so we should have some info about that."
"Well we can just set some parameters and return the UI as a functional... *trails off*"

Eventually we'll have office hours


Send updates in the channel! 

cells: homogenous cell types, tissues
live vs dead
dead: frozen, fixed
multiple tiessues: 
autologous samples


Add a category to the diagnosis type that includes all kind of tissues.
